my all redux assignments

This is my redux all assignments repository. I have completed a paid redux course on Learn-with-Sumit platform.

All the assignments (from assignment-4 to assignment-final) JSON-server was used. The servers folder, thats are required, attached in respective branch. Before starting the live project, please make sure to start the servers at **http://localhost:9000** by installing node module first (command: **npm install**) and then starting (command: **npm start**) the server.
